At this [eccomerce website](https://eccomerce-demo.herokuapp.com/#/) people can register and look for their favorite products. The site has a customer view, where he is able to make purchases, manage his personal info and view the history of purchases on the site. On the other hand, the admins' site allows the staff to manage stock, users and orders.
PayPal Payment Platform enables the customer to have a secure purchase experience.
The tech stack used to build this side was:
* Django Rest Framework to build APIs.
* JWT for the authentication proccess.
* React for the UI.
* SQLite for data persistance (only for demo purposes).
* AWS S# for static files storage.
* Heroku to host the site.
You can se the demo on the next [link](https://eccomerce-demo.herokuapp.com/#/).
